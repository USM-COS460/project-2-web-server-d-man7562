## COS 460/540 - Computer Networks
# Project 2: HTTP Server

# Domenic Mancuso

This project is written in python on Windows 10.

## How to compile

python is an interpreted language, so it does not need to compile.

## How to run

py httpserver <PORT> <dir>

## My experience with this project

I learned the usage of http requests, I got to use threading, and I was able to experience running a HTML project. I do not create web prages so this was a good experience.
